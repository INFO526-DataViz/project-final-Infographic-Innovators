### Project Setup - 12/06/2023

-   We have implemented visualizations related to flight crashes using the NTSB data.
-   We have implemented:
    -   A time series analysis plot with animation.
    -   A radial bar plot distinguishing total crashes and total injuries across different flight phases.
    -   A radar plot visualizing total crashes across different months.
    -   A Hex Bin Map plot to visualize at what places in the US most crashes have been recorder.

### Thing to do

-   Exploring `probable cause` for the crashes and visualizing it.
-   Refining the generated visualizations.
-   Implementing a shiny app or a dashboard to display all the visualizations we have analyzed.
