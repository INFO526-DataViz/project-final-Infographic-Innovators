It encompasses detailed records of aircraft crashes in the U.S. from January 1, 1980, to December 31, 2022. The dataset is structured as a tibble with 89,134 rows and 38 columns, out of which a few unnecessary columns has been removed for our purpose which resulted in a tibble with 89,134 rows and 20 columns. This rich dataset is ideal for our purpose because it enables both time-series, geo-spatial analysis and also other factors that affect the crashes - methods we believe are critical for understanding the dynamics and geo-spatial distribution of aircraft accidents over time.\n\n\nFlights Report Data Diagnosis Code\n# Getting basic information about the dataset\n\nflights_ntsb |&gt;\n  diagnose() |&gt;\n  formattable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariables\n\n\ntypes\n\n\nmissing_count\n\n\nmissing_percent\n\n\nunique_count\n\n\nunique_rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nevent_type\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\n8\n\n\n0.008975251\n\n\n3\n\n\n3.365719e-05\n\n\n\n\nevent_date\n\n\nPOSIXct\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.000000000\n\n\n80322\n\n\n9.011376e-01\n\n\n\n\ncity\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\n8\n\n\n0.008975251\n\n\n19038\n\n\n2.135885e-01\n\n\n\n\nstate\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\n155\n\n\n0.173895483\n\n\n58\n\n\n6.507057e-04\n\n\n\n\nhas_safety_rec\n\n\nlogical\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.000000000\n\n\n2\n\n\n2.243813e-05\n\n\n\n\nreport_type\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.001121906\n\n\n5\n\n\n5.609532e-05\n\n\n\n\nhighest_injury_level\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\n126\n\n\n0.141360199\n\n\n5\n\n\n5.609532e-05\n\n\n\n\nfatal_injury_count\n\n\nnumeric\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.000000000\n\n\n52\n\n\n5.833913e-04\n\n\n\n\nserious_injury_count\n\n\nnumeric\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.000000000\n\n\n24\n\n\n2.692575e-04\n\n\n\n\nminor_injury_count\n\n\nnumeric\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.000000000\n\n\n49\n\n\n5.497341e-04\n\n\n\n\nprobable_cause\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\n29568\n\n\n33.172526757\n\n\n56119\n\n\n6.296026e-01\n\n\n\n\nlatitude\n\n\nnumeric\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.000000000\n\n\n61321\n\n\n6.879642e-01\n\n\n\n\nlongitude\n\n\nnumeric\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.000000000\n\n\n62243\n\n\n6.983082e-01\n\n\n\n\nair_craft_category\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\n13\n\n\n0.014584782\n\n\n38\n\n\n4.263244e-04\n\n\n\n\nairport_id\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\n40230\n\n\n45.134292189\n\n\n9656\n\n\n1.083313e-01\n\n\n\n\nairport_name\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\n32675\n\n\n36.658289766\n\n\n25807\n\n\n2.895304e-01\n\n\n\n\namateur_built\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.000000000\n\n\n7\n\n\n7.853344e-05\n\n\n\n\nnumber_of_engines\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\n1546\n\n\n1.734467207\n\n\n40\n\n\n4.487625e-04\n\n\n\n\nair_craft_damage\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\n21\n\n\n0.023560033\n\n\n29\n\n\n3.253528e-04\n\n\n\n\nweather_condition\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\n173\n\n\n0.194089797\n\n\n7\n\n\n7.853344e-05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlights Report Data Describe Code\n# Getting basic statistical information about the dataset\n\nflights_ntsb |&gt;\n  describe() |&gt;\n  formattable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndescribed_variables\n\n\nn\n\n\nna\n\n\nmean\n\n\nsd\n\n\nse_mean\n\n\nIQR\n\n\nskewness\n\n\nkurtosis\n\n\np00\n\n\np01\n\n\np05\n\n\np10\n\n\np20\n\n\np25\n\n\np30\n\n\np40\n\n\np50\n\n\np60\n\n\np70\n\n\np75\n\n\np80\n\n\np90\n\n\np95\n\n\np99\n\n\np100\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfatal_injury_count\n\n\n89134\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.3635538\n\n\n2.251023e+00\n\n\n7.539771e-03\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n65.05258\n\n\n5829.500\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.00\n\n\n0.0000\n\n\n0.0000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n1.00000\n\n\n2.00000\n\n\n4.00000\n\n\n2.650000e+02\n\n\n\n\nserious_injury_count\n\n\n89134\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.1950210\n\n\n7.612223e-01\n\n\n2.549704e-03\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n37.67354\n\n\n3044.159\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.00\n\n\n0.0000\n\n\n0.0000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n1.00000\n\n\n1.00000\n\n\n2.00000\n\n\n8.100000e+01\n\n\n\n\nminor_injury_count\n\n\n89134\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.3146386\n\n\n1.399480e+00\n\n\n4.687541e-03\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n42.29602\n\n\n3134.592\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.00\n\n\n0.0000\n\n\n0.0000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n1.00000\n\n\n2.00000\n\n\n3.00000\n\n\n1.370000e+02\n\n\n\n\nlatitude\n\n\n89134\n\n\n0\n\n\n988.6591476\n\n\n2.011036e+05\n\n\n6.735939e+02\n\n\n12.22944\n\n\n211.29325\n\n\n44673.978\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.00\n\n\n0.0000\n\n\n0.0000\n\n\n21.31861\n\n\n29.18\n\n\n31.18077\n\n\n33.94250\n\n\n35.97083\n\n\n38.55095\n\n\n40.43017\n\n\n41.40944\n\n\n42.56583\n\n\n46.36235\n\n\n58.41937\n\n\n64.40744\n\n\n4.351119e+07\n\n\n\n\nlongitude\n\n\n89134\n\n\n0\n\n\n-123.9442394\n\n\n6.343362e+03\n\n\n2.124701e+01\n\n\n34.84990\n\n\n-149.65240\n\n\n22435.028\n\n\n-1004241\n\n\n-158.58\n\n\n-147.7193\n\n\n-122.1001\n\n\n-116.60010\n\n\n-111.85\n\n\n-106.08916\n\n\n-96.58913\n\n\n-90.31158\n\n\n-84.50032\n\n\n-80.45880\n\n\n-77.00008\n\n\n-70.81000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n1.741242e+02"

This objective is fueled by our diverse personal experiences with air travel, which range from enthusiasm to apprehension. This stems from talking about places we’ve traveled to, we chose the data as some of us are more comfortable with flying than others. We decided by looking at aircraft crash data that it could be a chance to get more informed about aircraft crashes within the United States. By examining the data, we hope to gain a clearer understanding of the factors contributing to these incidents and alleviate some of the concerns regarding aviation safety. We wanted do time series analysis as well as geo-spatial analysis and this data presented itself as a great opportunity to do both. We intend to design a shiny app so that we can display the a time series change of crashes throughout the years."

    "text": "Plan of Action\n\nExamining Aircraft Crashes, with a focus on their locations, timings, and consequences\n\nHeat-Map - An Animated Heat-map of Aircraft Crashes in the United States Over Time:\nThe animated heat-map provides a dynamic and visually compelling representation of aircraft crashes across the United States. This data visualization leverages the latitude and longitude coordinates of crash locations and spans multiple years to reveal temporal patterns. This heat-map not only facilitates the identification of regions with higher crash frequencies but also offers insights into the evolving dynamics of air travel safety over time.\nTime-series Plot- Analysis of Aircraft Crashes and Fatalities:\nWe visualize the trend in aircraft crashes historically. We are going to plot this trend based on different aspects like total fatalities which is represented using column fatal_injury_count, serious_injury_count and minor_injury_count. Here they classify a particular injury count as a minor, serious and fatal injury based on the level of casualties that occurred in the crash. We also would like to highlight few notable airplane crashes in the history in our time-series analysis.\nRadial bar Plot - A Radial Perspective on Aircraft Crashes During Flight Phases:\nWe will be representing the count of crashes on the x-axis and the phases of flight (takeoff, landing etc,.) on the y-axis in a circular manner. We can transform the bar plot into a radial form, emphasizing the distribution of crashes during these critical flight stages. This visualization technique allows for a quick understanding of the relative frequency of crashes during takeoff and landing, enabling insights into the safety challenges faced during these flight phases.\n\n\n\nAnalysis of Causes of Crashes\n\nBar plot - Common Causes of Aircraft Crashes:\nThe bar plot offers an overview of the most common causes of aircraft crashes throughout the United States. Leveraging the probable_cause column, which contains concise descriptions of crash events, the bar plot employs text summarization techniques to extract and categorize these causes into manageable groups. This visualization provides a straightforward and insightful representation of the key factors contributing to aviation incidents, aiding in the identification of the primary causes that warrant further investigation.\nStacked Area Chart - Causes and Severity of Aircraft Crashes:\nThe stacked area chart delves into the relationship between specific crash causes and the severity of injuries incurred. Drawing from the probable_cause column, as well as the severity and event_date columns, this visualization quantifies the number of crashes attributed to each cause while distinguishing between varying levels of severity. By visualizing this data in a stacked area format, it becomes evident which causes are associated with more severe injuries and which contribute to milder consequences.\n\n\n\nAssessing the Influence of Weather Conditions on Crashes\n\nRadar Plot - Analysis of Aircraft Crashes by Month and Weather Conditions:\nUsing radar plot we would like to display multiple weather conditions on the axes of the plot, while the spokes represent different months. Each radar plot point signifies the frequency of crashes occurring in a specific month under a particular weather condition. This comprehensive visualization enables a quick assessment of the relationship between weather conditions, crash occurrences, and the month when the crash has occurred.\n\nUltimately, we plan to utilize the interactive features of the Shiny application to present these plots in a user-friendly manner.\n\n\nVariables of focus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nevent_type\nType of event - accident, incident or occurrence\n\n\nevent_date\nDate time of when the event has occurred\n\n\ncity\nThe city or place location closest to the site of the event\n\n\nstate\nThe state in which the site of the event is present\n\n\nhighest_injury_level\nIndicate the highest level of injury among all injuries sustained as a result of the event\n\n\nfatal_injury_count\nThe total number of fatal injuries from an event\n\n\nserious_injury_count\nThe total number of serious injuries from an event\n\n\nminor_injury_count\nThe total number of minor injuries from an event\n\n\nprobable_cause\nThe probable cause for the aircraft crash as per the NTSB report\n\n\nlatitude\nLatitude for the event site in degrees and decimal degrees.\n\n\nlongitude\nLongitude for the event site in degrees and decimal degrees.\n\n\nweather_condition\nThe basic weather conditions at the time of the event"

    "text": "Examining Aircraft Crashes, with a focus on their locations, timings, and consequences\n\nTimeseries analysis of fatalities, and types of injuries\nApproach\nWe aim to analyze the historical data on fatalities and injuries to understand the trends over the years. To initiate our investigation, we have created two animations. The first animation illustrates the cumulative count of both fatalities and injuries over time, employing the geom_line() function and incorporating a flight image to signify the movement of data points within the plot. In the second animation, we have categorized fatalities based on the severity of injuries, providing a visual representation of how different types of fatalities have evolved over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFindings\nThere has been a general decrease in the number of total fatalities from 1980 to 2022. A notable spike in fatalities was observed in 2001, attributed to the 9/11 attacks. Post-2001, a significant decline in fatalities was noted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoropleth map on number of crashes in different regions(US map)\nApproach\nThe approach for creating a choropleth map of flight crashes in different U.S. regions involves data preparation, map generation, and animation. The dataset is filtered for valid latitude and longitude values, and relevant columns are selected. To ensure completeness, unique states and all years are identified. A function, is defined to create maps for each input year, customizing color scales. Maps are saved for each year using a loop.\nThe animation is created by loading saved map images, joining them into a sequence, and generating the animation. The resulting animation visually represents the temporal evolution of flight crashes across U.S. states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFindings\nLooking at the choropleth map Alaska, Arizona, Texas, and Florida has the highest number of crashes.\n\n\nRadial Bar Plot\nApproach\nWe plotted the radial bar plot to explore the distribution of flight crashes and associated injuries across different phases of flight. By categorizing flight phases into Landing, Takeoff, Approach, Maneuvering, Climb, and Other this visualization aims to uncover insights into the critical moments during a flight where incidents are more likely to occur. The first graph highlights the count of crashes in each phase, while the second graph focuses on the count of injuries, providing a broad perspective on the safety challenges associated with each phase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFindings\nThe radial bar plot offers an intuitive and visually appealing representation of the distribution of crashes and injuries throughout various phases of flight. In the first graph, the bars radiating from the center depict the count of crashes in each phase, allowing for a quick comparison of their frequencies. This visualization enables the identification of phases that might be particularly prone to incidents, guiding further investigation into the contributing factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second graph, depicting injuries, provides an additional layer of analysis. By comparing the counts of injuries across different flight phases, we can discern whether certain phases are more likely to result in severe consequences. This insight is crucial for understanding the potential risks associated with specific segments of a flight, informing safety measures and protocols."

It generates a waffle chart using ggplot2, displaying causes represented by ‘✈’ symbols in a grid layout, each tile proportional to the cause’s percentage, and then converts it into an interactive plot using plotly for visualization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFindings\nThe waffle chart effectively showcased the distribution of crash causes, emphasizing the prominence of human error(pilot failures) in aviation incidents. The data highlighted the need for enhanced safety measures and training to address the identified causes of crashes.\n\n\nDensity Plot\nApproach\nWe plotted the density plot using ggplot’s geom_density function is to visually analyze the distribution of flight crashes over the years based on their probable causes. By utilizing the probable_cause_flights dataset and focusing on the cause_summary column, this visualization aims to provide insights into the changing patterns and trends of aviation incidents. The x-axis represents the years, offering a chronological perspective, while the y-axis portrays the density of crashes associated with specific causes. Here, we have focused on the attribute Pilot's Failure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFindings\nThis visual representation allows us to identify clusters of high density, indicating periods or years where certain causes were more prevalent. Additionally, it facilitates the detection of outliers or shifts in patterns, enabling a more nuanced exploration of the dataset. Here, we can see that injuries in particular have reduced overtime with the number of Fatal Injuries reducing significantly over the past few decades."

Leveraging the flights_ntsb_radar dataset which we derived from the original flights_ntsb dataset and categorizing flight crashes based on Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) and Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). This visualization seeks to highlight the varying degrees of impact these conditions have on aviation safety. By layering both datasets on a radar plot, we aim to provide a holistic perspective on how different weather scenarios contribute to flight incidents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFindings\nThe radar plot serves as an effective means to showcase the multivariate nature of weather conditions and their relationship with flight crashes. Each axis on the radar represents a specific parameter related to aviation safety, such as visibility, cloud cover, wind speed, and temperature. The radar plot allows for the simultaneous comparison of these parameters for VMC and IMC, unveiling patterns and discrepancies in their respective contributions to incidents."

The number of fatalities has also gone down due to the stringent rules in the Aviation industry. With the fatalities and crashes decreasing over time and more we are moving towards a safer and faster mode of transport which can get us around the globe in a span of a couple hours.\nOverall trends indicate a decrease in total fatalities from crashes over the 1980-2020 period, with a notable spike in 2001 attributed to the events of 9/11. Specific regions like Alaska, Arizona, Texas, and Florida exhibited higher crash frequencies. Pilot error emerged as the predominant cause, followed by mechanical failures. Severity of crashes varied based on different causes, as depicted in the stacked area chart. Furthermore, distinct weather patterns correlated with increased crash occurrences in specific months, as revealed by the radar plot."
