It encompasses detailed records of aircraft crashes in the U.S. from January 1, 1980, to December 31, 2022. The dataset is structured as a tibble with 89,134 rows and 38 columns, out of which a few unnecessary columns has been removed for our purpose which resulted in a tibble with 89,134 rows and 21 columns. This rich dataset is ideal for our purpose because it enables both time-series, geo-spatial analysis and also other factors that affect the crashes - methods we believe are critical for understanding the dynamics and geo-spatial distribution of aircraft accidents over time.\n\n\nFlights Report Data Diagnosis Code\n# Getting basic information about the dataset\n\nflights_ntsb |&gt;\n  diagnose() |&gt;\n  formattable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariables\n\n\ntypes\n\n\nmissing_count\n\n\nmissing_percent\n\n\nunique_count\n\n\nunique_rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nevent_type\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\n8\n\n\n0.008975251\n\n\n3\n\n\n3.365719e-05\n\n\n\n\nevent_date\n\n\nPOSIXct\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.000000000\n\n\n80322\n\n\n9.011376e-01\n\n\n\n\ncity\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\n8\n\n\n0.008975251\n\n\n19038\n\n\n2.135885e-01\n\n\n\n\nstate\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\n155\n\n\n0.173895483\n\n\n58\n\n\n6.507057e-04\n\n\n\n\ncountry\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.000000000\n\n\n1\n\n\n1.121906e-05\n\n\n\n\nhas_safety_rec\n\n\nlogical\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.000000000\n\n\n2\n\n\n2.243813e-05\n\n\n\n\nreport_type\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.001121906\n\n\n5\n\n\n5.609532e-05\n\n\n\n\nhighest_injury_level\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\n126\n\n\n0.141360199\n\n\n5\n\n\n5.609532e-05\n\n\n\n\nfatal_injury_count\n\n\nnumeric\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.000000000\n\n\n52\n\n\n5.833913e-04\n\n\n\n\nserious_injury_count\n\n\nnumeric\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.000000000\n\n\n24\n\n\n2.692575e-04\n\n\n\n\nminor_injury_count\n\n\nnumeric\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.000000000\n\n\n49\n\n\n5.497341e-04\n\n\n\n\nprobable_cause\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\n29568\n\n\n33.172526757\n\n\n56119\n\n\n6.296026e-01\n\n\n\n\nlatitude\n\n\nnumeric\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.000000000\n\n\n61321\n\n\n6.879642e-01\n\n\n\n\nlongitude\n\n\nnumeric\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.000000000\n\n\n62243\n\n\n6.983082e-01\n\n\n\n\nair_craft_category\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\n13\n\n\n0.014584782\n\n\n38\n\n\n4.263244e-04\n\n\n\n\nairport_id\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\n40230\n\n\n45.134292189\n\n\n9656\n\n\n1.083313e-01\n\n\n\n\nairport_name\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\n32675\n\n\n36.658289766\n\n\n25807\n\n\n2.895304e-01\n\n\n\n\namateur_built\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.000000000\n\n\n7\n\n\n7.853344e-05\n\n\n\n\nnumber_of_engines\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\n1546\n\n\n1.734467207\n\n\n40\n\n\n4.487625e-04\n\n\n\n\nair_craft_damage\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\n21\n\n\n0.023560033\n\n\n29\n\n\n3.253528e-04\n\n\n\n\nweather_condition\n\n\ncharacter\n\n\n173\n\n\n0.194089797\n\n\n7\n\n\n7.853344e-05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlights Report Data Describe Code\n# Getting basic statistical information about the dataset\n\nflights_ntsb |&gt;\n  describe() |&gt;\n  formattable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndescribed_variables\n\n\nn\n\n\nna\n\n\nmean\n\n\nsd\n\n\nse_mean\n\n\nIQR\n\n\nskewness\n\n\nkurtosis\n\n\np00\n\n\np01\n\n\np05\n\n\np10\n\n\np20\n\n\np25\n\n\np30\n\n\np40\n\n\np50\n\n\np60\n\n\np70\n\n\np75\n\n\np80\n\n\np90\n\n\np95\n\n\np99\n\n\np100\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfatal_injury_count\n\n\n89134\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.3635538\n\n\n2.251023e+00\n\n\n7.539771e-03\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n65.05258\n\n\n5829.500\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.00\n\n\n0.0000\n\n\n0.0000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n1.00000\n\n\n2.00000\n\n\n4.00000\n\n\n2.650000e+02\n\n\n\n\nserious_injury_count\n\n\n89134\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.1950210\n\n\n7.612223e-01\n\n\n2.549704e-03\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n37.67354\n\n\n3044.159\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.00\n\n\n0.0000\n\n\n0.0000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n1.00000\n\n\n1.00000\n\n\n2.00000\n\n\n8.100000e+01\n\n\n\n\nminor_injury_count\n\n\n89134\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.3146386\n\n\n1.399480e+00\n\n\n4.687541e-03\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n42.29602\n\n\n3134.592\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.00\n\n\n0.0000\n\n\n0.0000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n1.00000\n\n\n2.00000\n\n\n3.00000\n\n\n1.370000e+02\n\n\n\n\nlatitude\n\n\n89134\n\n\n0\n\n\n988.6591476\n\n\n2.011036e+05\n\n\n6.735939e+02\n\n\n12.22944\n\n\n211.29325\n\n\n44673.978\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.00\n\n\n0.0000\n\n\n0.0000\n\n\n21.31861\n\n\n29.18\n\n\n31.18077\n\n\n33.94250\n\n\n35.97083\n\n\n38.55095\n\n\n40.43017\n\n\n41.40944\n\n\n42.56583\n\n\n46.36235\n\n\n58.41937\n\n\n64.40744\n\n\n4.351119e+07\n\n\n\n\nlongitude\n\n\n89134\n\n\n0\n\n\n-123.9442394\n\n\n6.343362e+03\n\n\n2.124701e+01\n\n\n34.84990\n\n\n-149.65240\n\n\n22435.028\n\n\n-1004241\n\n\n-158.58\n\n\n-147.7193\n\n\n-122.1001\n\n\n-116.60010\n\n\n-111.85\n\n\n-106.08916\n\n\n-96.58913\n\n\n-90.31158\n\n\n-84.50032\n\n\n-80.45880\n\n\n-77.00008\n\n\n-70.81000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n1.741242e+02"

This objective is fueled by our diverse personal experiences with air travel, which range from enthusiasm to apprehension. This stems from talking about places we’ve traveled to, we chose the data as some of us are more comfortable with flying than others. We decided by looking at aircraft crash data that it could be a chance to get more informed about aircraft crashes within the United States. By examining the data, we hope to gain a clearer understanding of the factors contributing to these incidents and alleviate some of the concerns regarding aviation safety. We wanted do time series analysis as well as geo-spatial analysis and this data presented itself as a great opportunity to do both. We intend to design a shiny app so that we can display the a time series change of crashes throughout the years."

This data visualization leverages the latitude and longitude coordinates of crash locations and spans multiple years to reveal temporal patterns. This heat-map not only facilitates the identification of regions with higher crash frequencies but also offers insights into the evolving dynamics of air travel safety over time.\nTime-series Plot- Analysis of Aircraft Crashes and Fatalities:\nWe visualize the trend in aircraft crashes historically. We are going to plot this trend based on different aspects like total fatalities which is represented using column fatal_injury_count, serious_injury_count and minor_injury_count. Here they classify a particular injury count as a minor, serious and fatal injury based on the level of casualties that occurred in the crash. We also would like to highlight few notable airplane crashes in the history in our time-series analysis.\nRadial bar Plot - A Radial Perspective on Aircraft Crashes During Flight Phases:\nWe will be representing the count of crashes on the x-axis and the phases of flight (takeoff, landing etc,.) on the y-axis in a circular manner. We can transform the bar plot into a radial form, emphasizing the distribution of crashes during these critical flight stages. This visualization technique allows for a quick understanding of the relative frequency of crashes during takeoff and landing, enabling insights into the safety challenges faced during these flight phases.\n\n\n\nAnalysis of Causes of Crashes\n\nBar plot - Common Causes of Aircraft Crashes:\nThe bar plot offers an overview of the most common causes of aircraft crashes throughout the United States. Leveraging the probable_cause column, which contains concise descriptions of crash events, the bar plot employs text summarization techniques to extract and categorize these causes into manageable groups. This visualization provides a straightforward and insightful representation of the key factors contributing to aviation incidents, aiding in the identification of the primary causes that warrant further investigation.\nStacked Area Chart - Causes and Severity of Aircraft Crashes:\nThe stacked area chart delves into the relationship between specific crash causes and the severity of injuries incurred. Drawing from the probable_cause column, as well as the severity and event_date columns, this visualization quantifies the number of crashes attributed to each cause while distinguishing between varying levels of severity. By visualizing this data in a stacked area format, it becomes evident which causes are associated with more severe injuries and which contribute to milder consequences.\n\n\n\nAssessing the Influence of Weather Conditions on Crashes\n\nRadar Plot - Analysis of Aircraft Crashes by Month and Weather Conditions:\nUsing radar plot we would like to display multiple weather conditions on the axes of the plot, while the spokes represent different months. Each radar plot point signifies the frequency of crashes occurring in a specific month under a particular weather condition. This comprehensive visualization enables a quick assessment of the relationship between weather conditions, crash occurrences, and the month when the crash has occurred."

You can use the display style with double dollar signs:\n$$\\bar{X}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$\n\\[\n\\bar{X}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i\n\\]\nLimitations:\n\nThe source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting $$ must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending $$ must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;\nThere should not be spaces after the opening $ or before the closing $."

You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.\nBut some of you might want to play around with slide styling.
